# Space Project ðŸŒŒ

## Overview
This project aims to create an interactive 3D space visualization using React Three Fiber and other supporting libraries like Drei and Three.js. The project allows users to explore a 3D representation of planets, stars, and other celestial objects. The frontend is developed using React, and it incorporates TailwindCSS for styling.

## Features
- **3D Planetary Model**: A realistic 3D model of planets and stars.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **User Interactions**: Users can rotate, zoom, and interact with objects in the 3D space.
- **Routing**: Integrated with React Router DOM for navigation between pages.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, used to create 3D graphics.
- **Three.js**: A 3D library used to build complex 3D environments.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Vite**: A fast frontend build tool.
